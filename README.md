#spatial

C++ header-only library of generic multi-dimensional containers, with iterators
over orthogonal range or nearest neighbors, modeled after the STL.

Web: https://sourceforge.net/projects/spatial/

# Installation

Spatial is a header-only library, and all you have to do is to copy the content
of the 'src' folder in a folder named 'spatial' under the appropriate header
directory for your project or your environment.

Typically on Linux, this just means:

```
$ sudo cp -a src/* /usr/local/include/spatial/
```

Using MSVC++ on Windows, you may install them under:
```
%Visual Studio location%\VC\include\spatial\
```
