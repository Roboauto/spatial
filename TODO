Spatial TODO List
=================

(Also used as a detailed roadmap, may change according to user
expectations or interests)

* Mar 11   Some documentation and unit test missing on the first
           release, so we just need to add them. Just a few are
           missing, only. Additionaly, check that the library is
           compiling fine on Visual Studio.

* Apr 11   Finish the implementation of the self-balancing containers,
           and create the new family of containers, frozen_pointset,
           in order to store points without rebalancing. By default,
           *_pointset will be self-blancing containers. This involves
           a heavy unit-testing and thus, it should take a good 3
           months.

* Jul 11   Add interator_cast() operators to cast a view interator
           into a container iterator, to facilitate erasing a node
           from a container, for example. Cause it currently involves
           quite a messy use of iterator constructor.

* Aug 11   Complete General doxygen documention with details on
           container and views, elaboration of how to write geometry,
           etc. This documentation should serve as a complete user
           manual, it should be accompanied by a bit of library
           polishing. Should take about 2 months. It would mark the
           milestone 1.0 release, and the end of the beta period, if
           enough people have used it.

* Oct 11   Addition of intrusive containers for every existing
           ones. The intrusive containers should have a rather limited
           inpact on the existing code if possible, but should make a
           great difference in terms of performance for those who need
           them. Should take about 2 months.

* Dec 11   Implementation of pointmap containers. Need to add quite a
           bit of unit testing, cause they differ from pointset in the
           sense that their iterator are not always constant. It
           should also take about 2 months. It would mark the 1.1
           release.
	   
* Feb 12   Work on boxset containers, add a new type of iterator:
           contain_iterator and intersect_iterator which walk through
           all the boxes that are contained in a range or that are
           intersecting a range, respectively. With unit tests, that
           should take a good 3 months. It would also mark the 1.2
           release.

* May 12   Add new iterators such at ray_iterator, which travels along
           a vector, in a given geometry. This iterator works only on
	   boxset family of iterators. Some new functions for geometry
           should appear and therefore, it would make defining a
           geometry quite a complex business, needing more
           documentation. Should take about 2 months.

* Jul 12   Add the boxmap family of iterators. That would mark the 1.3
           release and that would probably be the last release before
           a long, long period of bug fixing and compatibility
           improvements.

* Oct 12   Porting Spatial to scripting/duck-typing languages? Python,
           Lua, Ruby, .Net, others?
