Spatial Documentation
=====================

Generating the documentation
----------------------------

From this directory, execute Doxygen:

$ doxygen

Could it be harder?


Dependancies the documentation
------------------------------

To generate the bare documentation only Doxygen is required. You can download
Doxygen from its official website:

http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/index.html


However, Doxygen will not be able to generate the output for the formulas all by
itself. You also require pdfTex. pdfTex is part of most TeX distributions. On
Linux and BSDs it is generally not an issue to get pdfTex, but on Windows, it
may be a little more complicated. The following TeX distributions both provide
pdfTex:

http://www.miktex.org/
http://w32tex.org/

You may require to add the path to the pdfTex binary to your Windows PATH
enivronment variable.

If you do not have pdfTex, Doxygen will still include the formulas in the
documentation, however they will appear as LaTeX sources.


Writing the documentation
-------------------------

If you are not documenting a source files from the ../src directory, then you
need to add a file to the meta directory. The meta directory contains all the
files that are not directly linked to the sources, such as the tutorial and the
library description.
