	* First release with the following features:
	  * multi-dimension template containers with unlimited number of
	    dimensions to store points in space,
	  * dimensions may be of different types,
          * static or dynamic time determination of the number of dimensions,
	  * O(log(n)) class of complexity on insertion and removal,
	  * use custom predicate to define a range of elements,
	  * STL-compatible iterators that go over that range of elements,
	  * flexible definition of a metric space for elements in the container,
	  * STL-compatible iterators going from the nearest to the furthest
	    neighbr of a point according to the metric space applied.
