Spatial README
==============

Introduction
------------

After getting involved with libkdtree++, I had quite a number of new
ideas. Spatial was started from scratch and it aims at providing a library that
retains all the great benefits of libkdtree++ while broadening its horizons.

Like libkdtree++, Spatial is a header-only C++ library providing template
multi-dimension in-memory containers that should be reusable and that should be
tuned to offer good overall performance in various situations. Like it's parent,
Spatial borrows heavily from the STL, and strive to follow STL's interfaces
whenever possible.

Just like the STL containers ::std::multiset and ::std::multimap, Spatial was
designed to handle element insertion and removal from its containers in
logarithmic amortized time. Because of this characteristics, Spatial is
particularly well-suited for tracking analysis, real-time positioning, or
geographic information systems.

Features include:

    * multi-dimension template containers with unlimited number of dimensions
      to store points in space,
    * dimensions may be of different types,
    * static or dynamic time determination of the number of dimensions,
    * O(log(n)) class of complexity on insertion and removal,
    * use custom predicate to define a range of elements,
    * STL-compatible iterators that go over that range of elements,
    * flexible definition of a metric space for elements in the container,
    * STL-compatible iterators going from the nearest to the furthest neighbor
      of a point according to the metric space applied.


Instructions and Manual
-----------------------

You can find installation instructions in the file INSTALL, and the
documentation manual can by generated via Doxygen, from the 'doc' folder or the
same manual can be found on-line, at:
